                To get started with MyBuggy, you can create an account using
                your email address and phone number. This simple and
                straightforward registration process allows you to request a
                ride from your browser or the MyBuggy app, whichever is more
                convenient for you.
              </div>

            <div className="font-extrabold text-2xl md:text-3xl text-blue-800 mt-10">

              <div className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-light text-gray-600 lg:text-2xl pt-1 lg:w-1/2">
                The first step in using MyBuggy is for the passenger to open the
                app and type their destination into the "Where to?" field. The
                app will then present the rider with a list of available rides,
                each of which will include details such as the type of vehicle,
                the cost, and the expected arrival time. The rider can quickly
                and easily get where they need to go once they've decided on a
                ride and confirmed the pickup.

            <div className="font-extrabold text-2xl md:text-3xl text-blue-800 mt-10">
              Step 3
              <div className="font-bold text-gray-700">
                Check your driver details

              <div className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-light text-gray-600 lg:text-2xl pt-1 lg:w-1/2">
                Once the ride request is confirmed, MyBuggy's advanced algorithm
                matches the rider with a nearby driver who can fulfill the ride
                request. The driver will see the request and can choose to
                accept it. The rider will then receive automatic notifications
                from the app, letting them know when the driver's vehicle is
                approximately one minute away from the pickup location. This
                ensures a smooth and convenient pickup experience for the rider.

                Once the driver arrives at the pickup location, both the driver
                and the rider will verify each other's names and confirm the
                destination to ensure a secure and hassle-free ride. After the
                verification process is complete, the driver will start the ride
                and transport the rider to their desired location. MyBuggy's
                extensive network of trained and reliable drivers ensures a
                comfortable and safe journey for the rider.

                Once the ride has started, the driver will take the rider to
                their desired destination. To ensure an efficient and
                stress-free journey, MyBuggy provides drivers with turn-by-turn
                directions through the app. This feature allows the driver to
                navigate the route without any confusion and ensures that the
                rider reaches their destination safely and on time. With
                MyBuggy, riders can enjoy a comfortable and reliable
                transportation experience from start to finish.

                After the trip is complete, both the driver and the rider have
                the opportunity to rate each other on a scale of 1 to 5 stars.
                This rating system helps maintain the quality of service and
                provides valuable feedback for both parties. In addition to the
                rating, riders also have the option to give compliments and a
                tip directly through the app, making the entire experience even
                more convenient and user-friendly. With MyBuggy, riders can rest
                assured that their feedback will be taken into consideration,
                and they can enjoy a seamless and enjoyable transportation
                experience every time.
